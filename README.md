Tried to recreate this word clock I saw on Reddit:
https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/2ao9yt/i_built_this_word_clock_for_my_brother_and_his/

Using only vanilla JS, HTML5, CSS3.

Version 1: To-Do-List:
1. Refactor code to use classes and generally clean up code.
2. Add media query to make site responsive.
3. Add more validation rules.
4. Change birthday glow to RGB.
5. Disable submit button if input fields are not all filled
6. store information in local storage to persist through browser refresh/leaving site.

Version 2: Recreate project using React.
